        <p>
          Every single day, developers are <strong class="bold">building new sites and applications</strong> and creating <strong class="bold">innovative ways</strong> for users to consume content on the web. People expect websites to <strong class="bold">work regardless of the device or browser</strong> they are using. Sometimes it can be <strong class="bold">challenging for website developers</strong> to keep up with the countless ways we’re able to browse the internet today—computers, phones, tablets, TVs and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This challenge is what we are passionate about. The web is a <strong class="bold">valuable platform</strong> for creation, exploration, and discovery and we believe that <strong class="bold">everyone should have access</strong> to it regardless of device or browser choice. We need your help to make this a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Webcompat.com is developed by volunteers and supported by Mozilla. This site is an <span class="bold">open invitation for all web users, developers and browser vendors</span> to get involved in the web compatibility effort. Our goal is to make it easy to <strong class="bold">report and view compatibility problems</strong> for any part of the web.

        <h3 class="headline-1 highlight">What is Web Compatibility?</h3>
        <p>
          Web compatibility is about making sure web sites <strong class="bold">work the same way</strong> across all browsers and devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes sites have bugs or policies that prevent them from working well in every browser. Sometimes browser vendors have implemented features in different ways. We work to <strong class="bold">help web developers</strong> and <strong class="bold">site owners identify</strong> and <strong class="bold">fix</strong> such issues, or raise the issues to browser vendors or standards bodies to be fixed.

        <h4 class="headline-3">Bug Reporting</h4>
        <p>
          The first and most critical part of the process is to <strong class="bold">find and report</strong> compatibility issues around the web as we can just fix the issues that we know about.
        </p>
        <p>
           Have you found something and aren't sure if this is the right place to report that issue? Try to <strong class="bold">reproduce the issue</strong> in another browser. Does it work there? Try again in the first one. Still an issue? <strong class="bold">Congratulations!</strong> You found one. Send it in!
        </p>
        <p>
          Having <strong class="bold">steps to reproduce</strong> in a bug report is very helpful for everyone who takes care of triage and issue diagnosis.
        </p>

        <h4 class="headline-3">Bug Triage &amp; Diagnosis</h4>
        <p>
          In the next step of the cycle, we take <strong class="bold">care of the reported bugs</strong>. One member of our community tries to reproduce the issue. When they can reproduce it, it moves to diagnosis. They might have an issue reproducing and will come back with questions. If the issue was already reported or is not a web compat issue, it will be closed. Don't forget, <strong class="bold">every web compat report we get is one we can take care of</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After moving the issue to diagnosis, one member of our community digs into the code to figure out what’s causing the compatibility issue and or files bugs with browser vendors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes it might also be possible the relevant web technology standard is underspecified or browsers implement it in different ways. We help to <strong class="bold">provide feedback</strong> and make suggestions to the specifications to make them <strong class="bold">stable for everyone</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4 class="headline-3">Reaching Out</h4>
        <p>
          After finding what is causing the web compat issue, there are different ways to proceed. If the issue is caused by incompatible code, the community tries to <strong class="bold">contact the site owner or company</strong> behind it and suggest a fix.
