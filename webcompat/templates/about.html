        <p>
          Every day, developers are <strong class="bold">building new websites</strong> and creating <strong class="bold">innovative ways</strong> for users to consume content. People expect websites to <strong class="bold">work regardless of the device or browser</strong> they are using. Sometimes it can be <strong class="bold">challenging for website developers</strong> to keep up with the countless ways we’re able to browse the internet today—computers, phones, tablets, TV’s and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This challenge is what we are passionate about. The web is a <strong class="bold">valuable platform</strong> for creation, exploration, and discovery and we believe that <strong class="bold">everyone should have access</strong> to it regardless of device or browser choice. We need your help to make this a reality. 
        </p>

          Webcompat.com is developed by volunteers and supported by Mozilla. This site is an <span class="bold">open invitation for all web users, developers and browser vendors</span> to get involved in the web compatibility effort. Our goal is to make it easy to <strong class="bold">report and view problems</strong> for any part of the web.

        <h3 class="headline-1 highlight">What is Web Compatibility?</h3>
        <p>
          Web compatibility is about making sure web sites <strong class="bold">work the same way</strong> across all browsers and devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, sites have bugs or policies that prevent them from working well in every browser. We work to <strong class="bold">help web developers</strong> and <strong class="bold">site owners identify</strong> and <strong class="bold">fix</strong> such issues.

        <h3 class="headline-1 highlight">The three part life cycle</h3>
        <h4 class="headline-3">Bug Reporting</h4>
        <p>
          The first and most critical part of the process is to <strong class="bold">find and report</strong> compatibility issues around the web as we can just fix those issues, we know about.
        </p>
        <p>
           You found something and are not sure, if this is the right place to report that issue? Try to <strong class="bold">reproduce the issue</strong> in another browser. It works there? Try again in the first one. Still an issue? <strong class="bold">Congratulations!</strong> You found one. Send it in!
        </p>
        <p>
          Having <strong class="bold">steps to reproduce</strong> in a bug report is very helpful for everyone, who takes care of the traige. With these, we make sure, we work the best possible way to <strong class="bold">take care of your report</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4 class="headline-3">Bug Triage &amp; Diagnosis</h4>
        <p>
          In the next step of the cycle, we take <strong class="bold">care of the reported bugs</strong>. One member of our community tries to reproduce the issue. When they can reproduce it, it moves to diagnose. They might having an issue reproducing and will come back with questions, if the report wasn't sent in anonymously. If the report was already sent in or is not a web compat issue, it will be closed. Don't forget, <strong class="bold">every web compat report we get, is one we can take care of</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After moving the issue to diagnosis, one member of our community digs into the code to figure out what’s causing the compatibility issue and suggests a fix.
        </p>

        <h4 class="headline-3">Reaching Out</h4>
        <p>
          After finding what is causing the web compat issue, there are different ways to proceed. If the issue is caused by not compatible code, the community tries to <strong class="bold">contact the site owner or company</strong> behind it and suggest a fix. Gladly there are mailing lists with members of bigger sites, we can contact anytime. For smaller sites and companies, we might need help with finding the right contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes it might also be possible that the official specification is just partially done or there is an issue in there. We help to <strong class="bold">provide feedback</strong> and make suggestions to the specifications to make it <strong class="bold">stable for everyone</strong>.
