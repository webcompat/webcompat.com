      <p>
        People expect websites to work regardless of the device or browser they are using. When a site works in one browser but not another, that is most likely a web compatibility bug that we want to know about.

        <li>Retry in the first one. Still there?</li>
        <li>Congratulations! You found one! ðŸŽ‰ </li>
