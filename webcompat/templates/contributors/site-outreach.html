            <p>Now it's time to track down someone to help get the fix implemented, but first a few tips on doing outreach:</p>

            <dl>
              <dt>Be tactful</dt>
              <dd>People we are trying to reach have their own set of constraints, bosses, economic choices, etc. "Your web site sucks" will not lead anywhere, except NOT getting the site fixed.</dd>
              <dt>Be humble</dt>
              <dd>We are no better, we also do mistakes in our own practices. We recommend things which might change one day because of the technical/economical circumstances.</dd>
              <dt>Let it go</dt>
              <dd>Sometimes it just doesn't work. The person at the end of the other line may say "no" or worse, not answer. It can be very frustrating. Accept it and move on.</dd>
              <dt>Be passionate</dt>
              <dd>The passion is in being able to find the right contact in a company without harassing them.  Every effort helps.</dd>
              <dt>Share with consideration</dt>
              <dd>Share any contact you attempted or made in the issue comments section.  It helps everyone to know the status so they can pitch in or not repeat work. That said -  be careful to not disclose private information such as names and emails. You may simply say: "I contacted someone at $COMPANY", "Someone from $COMPANY said thisâ€¦"</dd>
            </dl>

            <h2 id="browser-bugs">Browsers Implementation Bugs</h2>

            <p>If it is a browser bug, consider reporting it to the browser vendor:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><p><a href="https://crbug.com/new">Chrome bug reports</a></p>
              <figure>
                <img src="../img/chromebugreport.jpg" alt="Chrome Bug Report Screenshot"/>
              </figure>
              </li>
              <li><p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi">Firefox bug reports</a></li>
              <li><p><a href="http://bugreport.apple.com">Safari bug reports</a></li>
              <li><p><a href="https://bugs.opera.com/wizard/">Opera bug reports </a></li>
              <li><p><a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/IE">Internet Explorer bug reports </a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="website-issue">Website issues</h2>
            <p>If it is a web site issue, track down the site owner.  Try:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>Does the web site have a Twitter account?</strong> If the Twitter account seems to be run by a person, it can be a good start for initial contact.  Ask who you should contact with the fix.  If the Twitter account is just broadcasting information, move on.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Does the web site have a support email or an issue tracker?</strong>  This is a simple one, but there's no guarantee that your request will be addressed.  Most of the time the responses are automatic but it's better than nothing. If in return you get an ID and/or a URI, put it in the issue comments.</p>

              </li>
              </ul>

            <h3 id="human">Search for a human working there</h3>

            <p>You will get more chances of getting a resolution or understanding what the issue is about by reaching out someone.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>LinkedIn.</strong> This doesn't necessary work with all countries, but worth trying. You can start for example in your favorite search engine with:Web developer $COMPANY_NAME site:linkedin.com. This will list names of people who are likely to work there, some of them in their profile will have contact information and often Twitter accounts, personal web sites or emails.</li>
              <li><strong>Twitter.</strong> Some people put their company affiliation in Twitter.  Tweet or DM them if possible and ask who to contact. Always check if the Twitter account is active. Some people haven't used their account for ages. If so, move on.</li>
              <li><strong>SlideShare.</strong> When you can't find the information about a developer, you might want to try to search something such as $COMPANY_NAME site:slideshare.net or any appropriate keywords that will make you closer to a contact. Some companies have their developers speaking at conferences about issues with performances, etc. Be careful of talks related to sales or marketing. In the slides, there is often the contact information of the developer.
                <figure>
                  <img src="../img/slideshare.jpg" alt="SlideShare Screenshot"/>
                </figure></li>
              <li><strong>GitHub, etc.</strong> Search by individual person or by company names. Many developers have either company projects online and/or their personal projects. As usual be careful to not abuse or harass people with your requests.</li>
              <li><strong>Web designer.</strong> Sometimes when you can't reach a web developer, you may try to reach web designers who have also their own type of social networks such as <a title="dribbble.com" href="https://dribbble.com/">dribbble.com</a>. Usually they have contacts with web developers and may be able to give an introduction. In some web agencies, the web designer will be a good initial contact. Again, be tactful and don't make the life of the web designer harder in his/her own company.

                </figure></li>
              <li><strong>Corporate emails.</strong> This may work time to time. When you know the person is working in a specific company (You have last and first name), but you have been unable to find any contacts at all through twitter and so on. You might want to find out through search engines and/or people working at this company how the email addresses have been created. You may find that the pattern is firstname.lastname@company.example.org or lastnameF@ etc. You can try to send an email. The person will be probably surprised on how did you get the email address. So there is a risk to anger the person. Be gentle and explain. Try <a href="http://www.email-format.com/i/browse/" target="_blank">this email format tool</a>.</li>
              <li><strong>whois.</strong> Some Web sites have their contact information in the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+whois" target="_blank"> whois</a> of the Web site. It's becoming rarer and rarer, because people receive spam because of it.</li>
              <li><strong>Check the terms and conditions or privacy policy for email addresses.</strong> There could be hidden in long blocks of text so a search for  @ is helpful.  There may also be links in a website's footer to an investor or media relations page which could have a contact address, but be careful  not to annoy the company by sending mails about bugs to addresses that are clearly not relevant (e.g. investors@example.com).</li>
              <li><strong>Friend of a friend.</strong> You are likely well connected in the industry. And it's why, if you are a Mozilla contributor in a specific  country, you are a very important asset for the work we are doing. Local social networks in between companies is a lot denser. Search your LinkedIn,  Twitter and Github for connections who might be connected to that company.</li>
              <li><strong>Find the home site.</strong> Sometimes a Web site belongs to a bigger company (think about a Game company with many brands, or a TV  broadcaster, different services such as Google, Yahoo!, etc.), finding the home site will help understand the structure of the company and might lead to  the department which is really in charge of the Web site.</li>
              <li><strong>Check for unique technologies that can search for.</strong> Sometimes you may have additional hints about the technology used on the Web site and the type of people related to the site through the hiring page of the company. In small company Web sites, you will discover the programming languages which are used, these will help reduce the search.</li>
