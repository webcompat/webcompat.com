            <p>Someone has <a href="/contribute/report">reported a bug</a>. It has been successfully triaged. The issue is now in the <a href="https://webcompat.com/issues?page=1&amp;per_page=50&amp;state=open&amp;stage=needsdiagnosis&amp;sort=created&amp;direction=desc">needs diagnosis list</a>. You can help! </p>

            <h2 id="neutral">Have A Neutral Test Environment</h2>

            <p>To have a successful diagnosis of the issue, you will probably need to have a setup which makes it possible to have a fresh profile of the browser you are testing with. Previous logins, addons or web extensions, changed settings are parameters which might have influence on your ability to diagnose correctly the source of the issue. For example, on firefox you can <a href="http://www.otsukare.info/2014/11/12/configure-webcompat-browser">create a profile which resets</a> which each browser restart.</p>

            <h2 id="skills">Develop Competences, Have Impact</h2>

            <p><a href="https://webcompat.com/issues?page=1&amp;per_page=50&amp;state=open&amp;stage=needsdiagnosis&amp;sort=created&amp;direction=desc">Pick up an issue from the list</a> and starts analyzing the reasons. You will probably spend a lot of time in the developer tools of each browser, tweaking values, inserting breakpoints in JavaScript code, reading specifications. Without realizing it, after a while, you will learn a lot about the subtle differences in between browsers. </p>

            <p>You might end up opening an issue on one of the browser reporting systems, because you discovered something off with the core engine of the browsers (such as Gecko on Firefox, Blink on Chrome/Opera and others, and WebKit on Safari). The Web platform will be a better place because of you.</p>

            <h2 id="verbose">Be verbose</h2>

            <p>Provide as <a href="@@insert link of a good analysis@@">much details as possible</a> during your analysis. Your thought process in diagnosing the issue is as important as your conclusion. It helps other people who are in charge of contacting websites and websites owners to have a better understanding of the issue. It will be quicker to negotiate a fix once all the details are known.</p>

            <p>@@question: provide some links to more in depth articles or maybe we reference a wiki page which has the links (MDN?). This avoid to have to do pull request to adjust the list.@@</p>
