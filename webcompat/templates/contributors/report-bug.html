            Once upon a time there was an issue on a website. Something is behaving differently in your favorite browser and not in another one. A menu is not working; the layout is a bit off; you click or tap on this link but it doesn't respond. This seems like a good time to file a bug report on webcompat.com! Since we can’t fix every issue on the web, we have <a href="#tools">tools</a> and <a href="#recommendations">recommendations</a> to help you understand what issues are not in the scope of this project.

            When reporting an issue directly on webcompat.com or through external tools, you will always end up on the <a href="/issues/new">webcompat form</a>. Some of the fields in this form are mandatory. Take time to be precise and to guide us through the steps that will make it possible to reproduce the issue.

When you are identified, we can better follow-up with you if there are additional information required to understand the issue. Anonymous issues which lack details will be closed when we can't reproduce the issue and create a diagnosis.

            In general there are four type of issues:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Website issues, including layouts, features or content. Webcompat.com is the right place! Not all site issues are valid Web Compatibility issues. Network issues, ads and script blockers, flash requirements for every browser are likely <a href="http://www.otsukare.info/2017/10/05/what-is-a-webcompat-issue" target="_blank"> not compatibility issues</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deceptive websites (scams, malware). You can report them to the <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/" target="_blank">Report Phishing Page</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Issues with the user interface of the browser itself and not the content of a website. These suggestions should be reported directly to the browser vendor.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add-ons or web extensions. Report these issue directly to the creator of the extension.
