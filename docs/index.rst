Welcome to Web Compatibility App Development's documentation!
=============================================================

What about Web Compatibility?
-----------------------------

An individual person, when using or creating on the Web, should have the freedom of choice of their browsers. It is then expected that their experience is not limited to one or two products. Sites they visit should work.

`webcompat.com <http://webcompat.com/>`_ is a collaborative Web site for helping everyone to report bugs about Web sites for any browsers. Once the bug has been reported, it is tested, analyzed and eventually the site owners are contacted for encouraging them to fix it.

What about this documentation?
------------------------------

We describe **how someone can get involved** in the development of `webcompat.com <http://webcompat.com/>`_ Web site. We are not describing how to use the Web site for solving Web Compatibility issues. You will find information about design and code conventions, UX, architecture of the application and hosting. If you think we have forgotten a section or that the documentation lacks clarity, please `open a bug <https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues/>`_ with your comments. Do not forget to add any suggestions on how to improve the documentation.

If you feel intimidated by the project, do not forget to check for `good first patch <https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-patch>`_.
